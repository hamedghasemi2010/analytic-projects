# 🌱 Greenhouse Climate Analysis

This project analyzes climate data from a greenhouse environment to uncover trends, correlations, and actionable insights for optimizing plant growth conditions.

## 📊 Objectives

- Track temperature, humidity, light and CO2 levels over time
- Detect abnormal patterns or outliers in the data
- Analyze daily or periodically trends
- Visualize data interactively for decision-making

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **VBA** - Convert **dtl** files to **csv**
- **Batch file** - Call an app to conversion
- **Excel** – Data cleaning, modeling, and visualization
- **Power Query** – Data transformation and automation

## 📁 Project Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `climate_data.xlsx` | Raw and cleaned climate data |
| `greenhouse_dashboard.xlsx` | Interactive dashboard built in Excel |
| `README.md` | Project documentation |

## 📈 Sample Visuals

*(You can add screenshots here once available)*

## 📌 Key Insights

- Daily humidity peaks around midday and drops sharply at night
- CO2 levels fluctuate with ventilation system schedule
- Weekly patterns correlate with manual watering events

## 📅 Future Improvements

- Automate data import from sensors
- Build predictive model for climate control suggestions
- Migrate to Power BI or Python-based dashboard
